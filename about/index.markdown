Tanuki.ai aims to help bars be more effective for patrons and hence owners. We will leverage technology that already exists a typical izakaya or bar â€“ first, cameras and point-of-sale computers. This will deliver analytics on how the business is doing.

By using the patterns of bar events, we will learn what it *looks like* a minute before an order is typed into a point-of-sale computer. We can then be proactive in spotting who might like another drink. Today we recognise patrons, but later we recognise drinks, as well as all the objects and events that take place in a social environment.
