By being able to match visual data with other signals, Tanuki can learn new visual cues:
* What does it look like when someone is going to order a drink in a minute?
* What does it look like when a glass is going to be broken in a minute?
* What does it look like when a date is not going to last?
* Who left this glass here?
* What do each of your menu items look like?
* Are your staff acting abnormally today?
* What is each patron's blood-alcohol concentration?
* What is each patron's heart rate?
