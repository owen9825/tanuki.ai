Computer vision is becoming more powerful ‚àí at the moment, it can not only recognise faces, but also emotion, gender and age. Regular cameras are being applied to areas where they aren't even the most appropriate sensors, such as the identification of flowers. We all recognise the cherry blossom üå∏, but maybe not other flowers. Bees see in a wider spectrum and have an easier job. Cats üêà can see in the dark. Thanks to so many available photos, AI has learnt to solve these sorts of problems despite the difficulties. People love taking photos and the advancement of technology follows what people want.

People do not want cameras *spying* on them, but they do want AI to look after their health; their financial decisions; and their offspring. We must apply technology with a good purpose, not to manipulate. Humans visit izakayas to lift their spirits ‚àí let us make bars as effective as possible, then the owner will likewise be satisfied.
