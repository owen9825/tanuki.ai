Cameras have previously been capable of just saving pixels for someone else to watch âˆ’ the computers themselves could not understand what was in the image. Now though, cameras can recognise faces, emotion, gender and age.

Bars can currently analyse sales, but the patrons are coming for more than just alcohol; they're coming to be part of a curated social space. Since our societies use visual communication so heavily, the use of cameras allows us to capture so much that the POS was not telling us.
