* How long does each patron stay in the bar?
* How often does each patron return to one of your bars around the city?
* How many new patrons are visiting your bar for the special event you organised?
* Did a celebrity just enter your bar?
* How often is a patron smiling tonight, compared to their regular behaviour?
* How old is the typical crowd at each of your bars?
* How old are your wine drinkers vs beer drinkers?
* How does the gender distribution vary throughout the night?
* Are there any patrons whose presence affects the gender distribution?

Bars can currently analyse sales, but the patrons are coming for more than just alcohol; they're coming to be part of a curated society. Since our societies use visual communication so heavily, the use of cameras allows us to capture so much that the POS was not telling us.
